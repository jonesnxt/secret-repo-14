## Idle clicker game

A good starting point for a clicker game
All of the images, sounds, names can be changed
There are easy to use classes all for many objects in the game:
- TierUpgradeClass       is a class for the upgrade that are currently on the bottom of the screen, if you want more upgrades use this class
- ObjectForClickingClass is a class for the object that needs to be clicked for gaining points. If you want to have more objects to click, use this class
- ClickUpgrade  is a class for increasing clicking reward
- Audio is a class for playing Audio. This is a byspass of the problem that occurs then you call loadSound(...);

If you resize the window while playing you need to refresh the page but no need to worry because the progress is saved on every upgrade purchased and every 30 sec
